The sort_dicts_by_key function provides an efficient way to sort lists of dictionaries in Python using the built-in sorted function with a custom key lambda. This approach ensures O(n log n) time complexity, making it suitable for various data sizes. Input validation checks for list type and dictionary elements, raising TypeErrors for invalid inputs to prevent runtime errors. The use of d.get(key, '') handles missing keys gracefully by defaulting to an empty string, allowing consistent sorting without exceptions.

Comprehensive testing confirmed correct sorting by existing keys (e.g., age, name), handling of missing keys (sorted as empty strings), edge cases like empty or single-element lists, and error scenarios for non-list inputs or non-dictionary items. The function is non-destructive, returning a new sorted list, and follows Python best practices with clear docstrings, type hints in comments, and readable code.

This implementation is concise yet robust, ideal for data processing tasks where dictionary lists need flexible sorting. For descending order, adding a reverse=True parameter to sorted would suffice. Overall, it balances simplicity, performance, and error handling, making it a reliable utility for developers working with structured data.
